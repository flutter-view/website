As a new year start, Flutter-view 1.0.0 now has been released. 

All known bugs have been fixed, so working with flutter-view makes creating interfaces in Flutter faster and easier than ever. The [documentation](https://docs.flutter-view.io) is now also complete, with documentation of every supported tag and shortcut.

This all means there is no better time to [get started with flutter-view](https://docs.flutter-view.io)!

As always, please enjoy using Flutter-view, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact or leave an issue on the [flutter-view repo](https://github.com/flutter-view/flutter-view).
