## Maintenance

Flutter-view has been updated to use the new Flutter and Dart dependencies.
Also, 1.0.1 has a fix for Dart text escaping having been changed.

## Renamed flutter-view-tools to flutter-tools-widgets

Besides this, the flutter-view-tools utility library has been renamed 
to [flutter-view-widgets](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_view_widgets). 
This was necessary because I no longer could update the old repository. 
Please update your dependencies to be able to follow future updates.

It has also been updated to version 1.0.6 with some small improvements.

## Future plans

I plan to add a new syntax to create flutter-views (not breaking the current implementation)
that allows you to generate both functions and widgets.


As always, please enjoy using Flutter-view, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact or leave an issue on the [flutter-view repo](https://github.com/flutter-view/flutter-view).
