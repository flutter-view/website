## Support for Dart 2.12+ and Null-safe code

Flutter-view now generates null-safe code!

Besides flutter-view itself, the `flutter-view-widgets` companion library
also got a null-safe update with `flutter_view_widgets: ^2.0.0-dev.1`.

If you upgrade to the new version, please upgrade this dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`.

* Note: If you have a legacy project and do not want to migrate to the new Dart version,
do not upgrade your flutter-view *

## Other changes

Besides null-safety support, the following features and fixes were added:

- Warnings now get ignored per file, and these warnings are [configurable](https://docs.flutter-view.io/guide/configuring-flutter-view#ignores).
- Support for `assign` has been dropped, as it was an antipattern
- HTML and CSS never worked correctly, and now only PUG and SCSS are supported
- Documentation has been updated to reflect all above changes
