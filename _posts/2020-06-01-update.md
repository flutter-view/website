## Letter-spacing added

Flutter-view has been updated to support the letter-spacing CSS property.
It directly translates to the same property in Flutter text.

Besides that the javascript libraries have been updated to the newest versions.

As always, please enjoy using Flutter-view, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact or leave an issue on the [flutter-view repo](https://github.com/flutter-view/flutter-view).
